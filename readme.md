## Intro

**s-AI-m** is a Twitter bot powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT API, designed to generate AI-driven tweets and interact with users through mentions. Responses are split into tweet-sized threads for easy readability.

This project was forked from [ChatGPT Twitter Bot](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-twitter-bot).

## Usage

Mention `@YourBotHandle` in a tweet with your prompt:

@YourBotHandle What's the capital of France?

The bot will reply with a threaded response.

## Acknowledgments
